# PROJECT MAP — Nexus Institute of Technology

Live site: **https://nexuskw.github.io/** · Repo: `github.com/nexuskw/nexuskw.github.io`
Local folder: `/Users/ilmshri/Social Media/nexus-institute`
Companion guide: **[OWNER_MANUAL.md](OWNER_MANUAL.md)** — step-by-step editing instructions.

This map lists every file and folder in the Nexus repository, split into two categories:

- 🟢 **EDITABLE CONTENT** — safe for you to modify. Worst case, a mistake here shows
  wrong text on one page; it will not take the site down.
- 🔴 **SYSTEM INFRASTRUCTURE — DO NOT TOUCH** — the machinery. Editing, renaming, or
  moving anything here can break the build or the live site.

> **The one rule that outranks everything: never rename or move ANY file, in either
> category.** File names are wiring — the build system finds content by exact name
> (`y1s1-computing.json` = Year 1, Semester 1, course "computing"). The names are
> systematic; what they mean is decoded below. Edit file *contents* (green ones),
> never file *names*.

## 🟢 EDITABLE CONTENT (safe to modify)

### `data/content/` — the lessons themselves (your main workspace)

One JSON file per fully-authored course. Each contains, per lesson: the **lecture**,
the **foundations** glossary table, and the 8-item **quiz**.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `data/content/y1s1-math-1.json` | Calculus I — all 11 lessons |
| `data/content/y1s1-drawing-cad.json` | Engineering Drawing & CAD — 11 lessons |
| `data/content/y1s1-statics.json` | Statics — 11 lessons |
| `data/content/y1s1-materials-1.json` | Materials Science I — 11 lessons |
| `data/content/y1s1-physics-1.json` | Physics I — 11 lessons |
| `data/content/y1s1-computing.json` | Engineering Computing — 11 lessons |

Naming code: `y1s1` = Year 1 Semester 1 · then the course id. New courses follow the
same pattern (`y1s2-math-2.json`, …).

### `data/y*.json` — the course catalog (edit carefully)

Eight files, one per semester (`y1s1.json` … `y4s2.json`). Each lists that semester's
courses: titles, summaries, lesson titles/scopes, video selections, and the per-course
**career** paragraph. Text fields are safe to edit (course summary, career block,
lesson scope). Structural fields (`id`, `n`, `tier`, `content`) are wiring — leave
them (see manual, "Catalog files").

### `content/pages/` — the site's standalone pages

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `content/pages/mission.html` | Mission page (English + Arabic in one file) |
| `content/pages/career.html` | Career Paths page (English) |
| `content/pages/career-ar.html` | Career Paths page (Arabic) |
| `content/pages/home.html` | Previous-generation home fragment (not shipped; archive) |

### `content/lessons/` — long-form lecture fragments

Eight hand-written casting/manufacturing lectures from the project's first build era
(`y1s1-mp1-01.html` … `y2s2-mp3-02.html`). Naming: semester + course + 2-digit lesson
number. Their text is editable; the build adapts their figures automatically.

### `assets/img/` — archived photo pool (inert)

Eight `.jpg` photos + `CREDITS.md`. **Not used by the live site** (Nexus is
vector-only). Kept as archive; harmless either way.

### Documentation (plain reading/writing, no build impact)

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | Public repo description |
| `DEPLOY.md` | Deployment reference |
| `PROJECT_MAP.md` | This file |
| `OWNER_MANUAL.md` | Your editing manual |
| `CLAUDE.md` | ⚠️ Special: the Nexus master brief + decision ledger. Editable *by agreement* — it is the continuation contract every future working session obeys. Add decisions; never delete history (older entries keep their original wording as the audit trail). |

## 🔴 SYSTEM INFRASTRUCTURE — DO NOT TOUCH

### The generators

| File | Why it's critical |
|---|---|
| `nexus_build.py` | **The Nexus build system.** Reads everything above, emits the whole site into `docs/`. All quality gates (no company names in lessons, verified videos only, etc.) are enforced here. |
| `build.py` | **Library the build system imports.** Previous-generation generator retained as the data-loading core of `nexus_build.py`. Deleting or renaming it kills every build. Never deploy from it directly. |

### The live site's engine room

| Path | Why it's critical |
|---|---|
| `docs/` (8.6 MB, ~579 pages) | **Generated output — the actual live site.** Never edit by hand: the next build overwrites everything in it. All changes go through the green files + a rebuild. |
| `assets/nx/` | The live Nexus design system: `nexus.css` (all styling), `nexus.js` (tabs, quiz engine, language toggle, progress), `manifest.webmanifest` + `sw.js` + `icons/` (the installable-app machinery). A typo in `nexus.js` breaks every quiz on the site. |
| `nexus/logo.svg` | The approved v5 Academic Shield logo, copied into the site at build. |
| `nexus/logo-v4-gear-coin-unapproved.svg` | Archived unapproved logo draft — keep as record. |
| `nexus/design-system.html` | Stage-1 design reference artifact. |

### Archived previous-generation design (inert but keep)

| Path | Why it stays |
|---|---|
| `assets/css/site.css`, `assets/js/site.js` | The retired first-generation design. Not shipped by the Nexus build; kept for history/rollback. |

### Working directories

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `drafts/phase2-quiz-mc-drafts/` | Unverified quiz drafts (drawing-cad) + authoring journal. The build deliberately ignores this folder. Do not promote drafts to live content — their arithmetic has not been machine-verified yet. |
| `data/sources.json` | Verified source/URL registry. Every link was checked live before entry — don't add links without verifying. |
| `.claude/launch.json` | Local preview-server config (`nexus-docs`) for working sessions. |
| `.git/` | Version history — your safety net. Never edit internals. |
