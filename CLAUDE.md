# SUN DEVIL FACTORY — MASTER BRIEF (final authority)

This file is the continuation contract for any model or person working on this
repository. Where any other instruction differs from this brief, this brief wins.

## FINAL DECISIONS (from the project owner)

1. Real hosted domain — build as a static site for GitHub Pages/Cloudflare Pages
   deployment, haruchika design language, real video embeds now allowed.
2. Full lecture depth for the agreed Core 60 lessons, structured-notes depth for
   the rest of the 48-course catalog.
3. Audience is a mechanical maintenance engineer transitioning into manufacturing
   with no manufacturing background — reframe as a transition pathway and write
   the career section tactically for that profile.

## MASTER BRIEF (verbatim)

PROJECT: Public educational website for a mechanical maintenance engineer
transitioning into manufacturing (no manufacturing background). Target roles:
Reliability, Asset Integrity, Production/Operations, Maintenance Planning.

ARCHITECTURE: Static site generator — ONE haruchika-style template +
build.py + curriculum.json (all courses/lessons as data; script emits every
page). Deploy to GitHub Pages free URL immediately; custom domain later.
FIRST COMMIT = CLAUDE.md containing this entire brief (model-agnostic
continuation insurance).

DESIGN: haruchika.co.jp language — paper-white base, near-black ink, steel-
gray secondary; serif editorial headlines, spaced small-caps "SUN DEVIL
FACTORY" wordmark (only branding); numbered sections (01,02…), hairline
rules, generous whitespace; full-bleed licensed photos, scroll reveals
(IntersectionObserver), hover captions; English only; no edtech look.

- Tier 1 (today: casting lecture only, gold standard): objectives; full
  derivations; 2 worked examples with units; misconceptions; check-your-
  understanding with hidden answer; refresher blocks; Kuwait tie-in.
- Tier 2 (Core 60, ~400-word study guides, batches of 8-10): objectives,
  key equations w/ named textbook source, 1 condensed worked example,
  misconceptions, Kuwait line, course-level video link.

SOURCES (only these; cite title+author; verify edition or omit it; never
fabricate; no Wikipedia/blogs): Groover Fundamentals of Modern Manufacturing;
Kalpakjian&Schmid Manufacturing Engineering&Technology; Black&Kohser
DeGarmo's; Flemings Solidification Processing; Campbell Complete Casting
Handbook; ASM Handbook Vol 15 Casting; Çengel&Ghajar Heat and Mass Transfer;
Çengel&Cimbala Fluid Mechanics; Callister&Rethwisch Materials Science;
Making Shaping and Treating of Steel (AISE); MIT OCW; NPTEL.

KUWAIT TIE-INS (only these companies; name process/equipment; never invent
plant data — label numbers "representative"): Kuwait Steel (EAF, billet
caster, rolling mill), Gulf Cable (wire drawing/stranding/extrusion), Kirby
(steel fabrication/welding), EQUATE (rotating equipment/asset integrity),
KDD/Petra (filling/packaging/utilities), HEISCO (fabrication/NDT/services).

MEDIA: ONE pool of ~8 openly-licensed photos (Wikimedia Commons; verify
license; honest captions — "representative example: X" when facility
unknown) reused site-wide. Videos today = course-level MIT OCW/NPTEL links
only, verified live. No fabricated URLs ever.

CAREER SECTION (full, today, tactical): maintenance→manufacturing CV
translation table; entry via maintenance/reliability roles at the six
companies first, production later; certs: CMRP flagship + ISO 18436 Cat I
vibration, API 510/570/653 flagged as experience-gated; KSE registration
note; interview topics mapped to Core 60; 12-month action plan.

EXECUTION: Hour 1 = repo, CLAUDE.md(this brief), template+script,
curriculum.json, career section, DEPLOY (public). Hour 2 = casting Tier-1
lecture, Core 60 study guides in batches, photo pool, video links, push
incrementally. Never trade correctness for speed — cut breadth instead.

## REPO ORIENTATION (how to continue)

- `build.py` — zero-dependency Python 3 generator. Run `python3 build.py`;
  output goes to `docs/` (GitHub Pages serves from /docs on main).
- `data/y{1..4}s{1,2}.json` — the curriculum: 48 courses, 522 lessons.
  Lesson fields: `n`, `t` (title), `tier` (1/2/3), `scope`, `src`,
  optional `core60` (block tag like "A4"), optional `content` (fragment id
  in content/lessons/), optional `kuwait`.
- `content/lessons/<id>.html` — body fragments for Tier 1/2 lesson pages.
  Fragment id convention: `<semester>-<course-id>-<lesson number two digits>`.
- `content/pages/` — home and career page fragments.
- `assets/` — site.css, site.js, img/ (photo pool with credits in
  `assets/img/CREDITS.md`).
- Preview locally: `python3 -m http.server -d docs 8000`.

### Content status ledger (update when you add content)

- Preview questions ("preview" field, rendered above Taught-from): 60/522 —
  Core 60 complete. Remaining batches in order: y1s1, y1s2, y2s1, y2s2,
  y3s1, y3s2, y4s1, y4s2 (Tier-3 lessons only; Core-60 already done).
  Rules: original wording, 2 conceptual questions per Tier-3 lesson,
  numeric micro-problems on Core-60, match the lesson scope + cited source,
  no invented plant data.
- Source registry: data/sources.json — every URL verified live before entry
  (OCW course pages, NPTEL course pages, Open Library work pages,
  smrp.org, nebosh.org.uk). Sources without verifiable official URLs stay
  plain text. build.py linkify() renders them.

- Tier 1 done: y1s1-mp1-02 (casting solidification), y1s1-mp1-03 (casting
  practice, quality & defects).
- Tier 2 done (batch 1, A-block): see ledger comments in data/y1s1.json and
  content/lessons/. Next batches in order: remainder of A (machining/welding/
  NDT/sheet/plastics), then B, C, D, E, F, G.
- Tier 2 lessons without a written guide yet are tagged `core60` but have no
  `content` field — the course page automatically shows them as
  "study guide queued".
- Every new Tier 1/2 page: follow the gold standard structure of
  y1s1-mp1-02/03. Verify every citation and URL before adding. Label all
  industrial numbers "representative" unless from a cited source.

### Writing rules (non-negotiable)

- Derive or source every equation. Never state a result bare.
- Only the SOURCES list above may be cited. Verify editions or omit them.
- Kuwait examples only from the six companies; name process/equipment;
  never invent plant data.
- All photo captions honest: "representative example: X" when the facility
  is not identifiable. Never caption a stock photo as a named Kuwait plant.
- No fabricated URLs. Verify every external link live before committing.
- English only. Professor's voice: direct, precise, no filler, no
  motivational language.
