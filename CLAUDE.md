# SUN DEVIL FACTORY — MASTER BRIEF (final authority)

This file is the continuation contract for any model or person working on this
repository. Where any other instruction differs from this brief, this brief wins.

## FINAL DECISIONS (from the project owner)

1. Real hosted domain — build as a static site for GitHub Pages/Cloudflare Pages
   deployment, haruchika design language, real video embeds now allowed.
2. Full lecture depth for the agreed Core 60 lessons, structured-notes depth for
   the rest of the 48-course catalog.
3. Audience is a mechanical maintenance engineer transitioning into manufacturing
   with no manufacturing background — reframe as a transition pathway and write
   the career section tactically for that profile.

## MASTER BRIEF (verbatim)

PROJECT: Public educational website for a mechanical maintenance engineer
transitioning into manufacturing (no manufacturing background). Target roles:
Reliability, Asset Integrity, Production/Operations, Maintenance Planning.

ARCHITECTURE: Static site generator — ONE haruchika-style template +
build.py + curriculum.json (all courses/lessons as data; script emits every
page). Deploy to GitHub Pages free URL immediately; custom domain later.
FIRST COMMIT = CLAUDE.md containing this entire brief (model-agnostic
continuation insurance).

DESIGN: haruchika.co.jp language — paper-white base, near-black ink, steel-
gray secondary; serif editorial headlines, spaced small-caps "SUN DEVIL

SOURCES (only these; cite title+author; verify edition or omit it; never
fabricate; no Wikipedia/blogs): Groover Fundamentals of Modern Manufacturing;
Kalpakjian&Schmid Manufacturing Engineering&Technology; Black&Kohser
DeGarmo's; Flemings Solidification Processing; Campbell Complete Casting
Handbook; ASM Handbook Vol 15 Casting; Çengel&Ghajar Heat and Mass Transfer;
Çengel&Cimbala Fluid Mechanics; Callister&Rethwisch Materials Science;
Making Shaping and Treating of Steel (AISE); MIT OCW; NPTEL.

KUWAIT TIE-INS (only these companies; name process/equipment; never invent
plant data — label numbers "representative"): Kuwait Steel (EAF, billet
caster, rolling mill), Gulf Cable (wire drawing/stranding/extrusion), Kirby
(steel fabrication/welding), EQUATE (rotating equipment/asset integrity),
KDD/Petra (filling/packaging/utilities), HEISCO (fabrication/NDT/services).

MEDIA: ONE pool of ~8 openly-licensed photos (Wikimedia Commons; verify
license; honest captions — "representative example: X" when facility
unknown) reused site-wide. Videos today = course-level MIT OCW/NPTEL links
only, verified live. No fabricated URLs ever.

CAREER SECTION (full, today, tactical): maintenance→manufacturing CV
translation table; entry via maintenance/reliability roles at the six
companies first, production later; certs: CMRP flagship + ISO 18436 Cat I
vibration, API 510/570/653 flagged as experience-gated; KSE registration
note; interview topics mapped to Core 60; 12-month action plan.

EXECUTION: Hour 1 = repo, CLAUDE.md(this brief), template+script,
curriculum.json, career section, DEPLOY (public). Hour 2 = casting Tier-1
lecture, Core 60 study guides in batches, photo pool, video links, push
incrementally. Never trade correctness for speed — cut breadth instead.

## REPO ORIENTATION (how to continue)

- `build.py` — zero-dependency Python 3 generator. Run `python3 build.py`;
  output goes to `docs/` (GitHub Pages serves from /docs on main).
- `data/y{1..4}s{1,2}.json` — the curriculum: 48 courses, 522 lessons.
  Lesson fields: `n`, `t` (title), `tier` (1/2/3), `scope`, `src`,
  optional `core60` (block tag like "A4"), optional `content` (fragment id
  in content/lessons/), optional `kuwait`.
- `content/lessons/<id>.html` — body fragments for Tier 1/2 lesson pages.
  Fragment id convention: `<semester>-<course-id>-<lesson number two digits>`.
- `content/pages/` — home and career page fragments.
- `assets/` — site.css, site.js, img/ (photo pool with credits in
  `assets/img/CREDITS.md`).
- Preview locally: `python3 -m http.server -d docs 8000`.

### Content status ledger (update when you add content)

- APPROVALS RECEIVED (owner, 2026-07-17 PM): (1) v5 Academic Shield logo
  APPROVED; (2) shell/UI/colors APPROVED; (3) 522→528 strict 6×11
  normalization APPROVED (execute in the NEXT session — 9 courses have 12
  lessons, 15 have 10; net +6); (4) Phase-2 order APPROVED (Year 1 content
  first). MISSION COPY REWRITTEN & DEPLOYED (owner's verbatim copy): hero
  "Learn Mechanical Engineering from Scratch to Industry 4.0."; audience =
  ANYONE, zero background; Two Doors = Complete Academic Curriculum +
  Modern Applications & Industry 4.0; integrity floor unchanged. SCOPE
  RULES (binding for ALL future content): the platform covers ALL
  mechanical-engineering roles (design, operations, maintenance, planning,
  thermal systems, fluid dynamics) — never manufacturing-only; Industry
  4.0/PLC/SCADA/automation integrated as modern extensions; NO company
  names in examples or text (existing named applied-cases and the Career
  page await a Phase-2 rewrite decision). BILINGUAL RULE (binding): AR
  version translates EVERYTHING (UI, cards, lesson content, worked
  solutions, quiz explanations) into formal Arabic EXCEPT numbers,
  equations, math symbols, proper nouns, and core technical terms, which
  stay English/original — with flawless bidi via <span dir="ltr"> (or
  <bdi>) isolation so mixed lines never break or flip punctuation.
  Handoff document issued to the owner for the next session; its pending
  tasks: execute 528 normalization, then Phase 2 Year-1 content.
- PHASE GATES REINSTATED (owner, 2026-07-17 PM — supersedes the zero-approval
  rollout where they conflict): NO content generation until the owner approves
  the Phase-1 design + logo. Phase 1 (SHIPPED, awaiting approval) = branding,
  UI/UX shell, architecture. Phase 2 (GATED) = content: Year 1-2 full tabs,
  math-1/drawing-cad quiz retrofits (unverified drafts preserved in
  drafts/phase2-quiz-mc-drafts/ — generator ignores that dir), computing
  course, mission-copy rewrite, per-lesson video curation, cert maps,
  foundations glossary-table migration, 522→528 normalization decision.
- MISSION REFRAME (owner): from-scratch online B.S. Mechanical Engineering
  institute for ANYONE with zero background; classic ME core with Industry
  4.0 / PLC / SCADA integrated in later stages. Mission-page copy still says
  "one specific person" — rewrite is Phase-2 text work, gated.
- LOGO v5 "Academic Shield" (nexus/logo.svg, PENDING owner approval): flat
  navy shield, amber keyline, teal 8-tooth gear with amber hub, cream open
  book; no gradients/filters. The v4 metallic gear-coin was NOT approved —
  archived untouched at nexus/logo-v4-gear-coin-unapproved.svg. Palette
  unchanged (v5 is built from the existing navy/teal/amber/cream tokens, so
  the platform already harmonizes with it). App bar uses a serif lockup
  ("Nexus Institute of Technology" + small-caps "Online Engineering
  Education").
- LESSON ARCHITECTURE (owner, STRICT, supersedes the earlier 4-tab spec):
  tab order is Lecture | Foundations | Examples and Quiz | Library.
  Lecture: 500-1000 words, textbook-style, NO solved examples. Foundations:
  glossary TABLE Term | Equation | When to use (style ready:
  table.glossary/.glossary-wrap; existing list-style foundations migrate in
  Phase 2). Examples and Quiz: 3 solved examples + 5-question MCQ graded by
  a Submit button (engine v2 LIVE: select-then-submit, per-question
  verdicts + explanations + score; solve items keep reveal buttons).
  Library: exactly ONE embedded video from the strict channel list below,
  else the "TODO: Find approved video" placeholder; then Textbooks &
  references (3 US-published texts per lesson in Phase 2; verified links
  only); then Related certifications & licenses (2-3 per lesson, Phase 2,
  verified links only — placeholders stay empty until verified).
- STRICT EMBED CHANNELS (owner correction, 2026-07-17 PM — supersedes ALL
  earlier embed policy; exactly these 15, enforced by APPROVED_CHANNELS in
  nexus_build.py): MIT OpenCourseWare, Engineer4Free, The Efficient
  Engineer, Jeff Hanson, Engineering Explained, Practical Engineering, The
  Engineering Mindset, RealPars, SolisPLC, AutomationDirect, Plcprofessor,
  GalcoTV, Hegamastery, Siemens Knowledge Hub, Schneider Electric Hub.
  NPTEL and LearnChemE are BANNED from embedding (verified text links in
  references only). Every URL still gets opened and verified before entry;
  channels not yet in the registry (e.g. Hegamastery) must be verified to
  exist before first use.

- NEXUS IS THE PLATFORM (owner EXECUTION OVERRIDE, 2026-07-17 — supersedes
  the stage gates and the "separate platform" plan): the live site at
  https://nexuskw.github.io/ IS Nexus Institute of Technology, replacing the
  Sun Devil Factory chrome. DEPLOY GENERATOR: `python3 nexus_build.py`
  (build.py is retained ONLY as the data/helper layer nexus_build.py imports
  — never deploy from build.py; it emits the retired SDF chrome).
  Platform rules (binding): centered brand + Mission | Curriculum | Career
  Paths pipe nav; FOUR tabs per lesson (Foundations | Lecture | Worked
  Examples | Library) — Kuwait floor content lives inside Worked Examples as
  "Applied case" blocks; zero "§" anywhere (nx_text() transform + build
  assertion); zero photography — original vector illustrations only (ILLOS
  in nexus_build.py, one motif per course; photo figures in Tier-1 fragments
  auto-convert to .fieldnote blocks keeping only the original NOTICE text);
  EN/AR bilingual chrome with RTL toggle (localStorage nx-lang), Mission +
  Career fully Arabic (content/pages/mission.html embeds both languages;
  career-ar.html is the Arabic career page); installable PWA (manifest +
  sw.js + icons, generated from nexus/logo.svg); honest completion tracker
  on the curriculum page, recomputed every build; library embeds are
  native-English YouTube only — NPTEL never embeds (text links only).
  CONTINUOUS ROLLOUT (owner order, zero approvals): every session author the
  next courses to full 4-tab depth (EN + AR lesson content) in queue order
  until 528/528; report coverage after every course. 522→528 normalization
  happens by AUTHORING the missing lessons (6 courses are short), never by
  padding. Coverage at handoff: 52/522 (10%) at full depth. RETROFIT still
  owed: math-1 + drawing-cad to 5-problem quiz format; then computing, then
  y1s2 onward. Arabic lesson content ships with each newly authored course.

- NEXUS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (2026-07-13): a SEPARATE platform (owner
  decision — does NOT replace the live ASU site). Staged rebuild lives in
  nexus/ (Stage 1 design system approved-pending: metallic planetary-gear
  logo per owner's reference image, teal #14CFA0/#07785C + amber #F5A623
  on whitish bg, 4-tab lesson model Foundations/Lecture/Worked Examples/
  Library, bilingual EN/AR RTL, PWA planned, no photography — original
  vectors only, no "§" anywhere). Stage gates: 2 = nav/IA, 3 = sample
  lesson, 4 = full rollout — each requires owner approval. Stage-1 artifact:
  https://claude.ai/code/artifact/23ea55c4-300a-41aa-a9d6-c3bf25ce1930

- STANDING ORDER (owner, 2026-07-13): fill ALL 522 lessons' five tabs with
  real content, course by course, WITHOUT per-batch approval. Content merges
  via data/content/<sem>-<course>.json ({lesson_n: {lecture, foundations,
  examples, kuwait}} — HTML, MathJax LaTeX allowed). Arithmetic in worked
  examples must be verified before writing. DONE: y1s1/math-1 (MTH 101),
  y1s1/drawing-cad (DRW 102), y1s1/statics (STA 103, 2026-07-17),
  y1s1/materials-1 (MAT 104, 2026-07-17) — 44 lessons full, all worked-example
  arithmetic machine-verified before writing. NEXT QUEUE: computing,
  then y1s2 onward. Every session: author as many complete courses as fit,
  EXAMPLES FORMAT (owner order 2026-07-17, supersedes the 2-example blob):
  every lesson's Worked Examples tab is a FIVE-problem interactive quiz —
  content JSON key "quiz": list of 5 items, order [solve, mc, mc, solve, mc].
  solve = {"type":"solve","q":html,"solution":html} (student attempts, then
  reveals the full solution); mc = {"type":"mc","q":html,"choices":[4 html],
  "answer":idx,"solution":html} (click → correct/wrong verdict + the correct
  choice highlighted + explanation auto-opens; one attempt, buttons disable).
  Rendered by quiz_html() in build.py; behavior in assets/js/site.js; styles
  .quiz-* in site.css. Asset URLs carry ?v=<content-hash> (cache busting —
  keep it). statics + materials-1 already converted (110 quiz problems, all
  numeric answers machine-verified; distractors are classic errors, named in
  the explanation). RETROFIT QUEUE: math-1 and drawing-cad still carry the
  old 2-example "examples" blob (renderer still supports it) — convert both
  to 5-problem quizzes before starting computing.
  rebuild, push (origin = sundevilfactory/asu, credential in keychain),
  verify live.

- ARCHITECTURE (2026-07-13, owner-approved): every lesson has its own page
  with FIVE TABS — Lecture / Foundations / Worked Examples / Kuwait Floor /
  Library (~573 pages total). Tabs are populated from real content at the
  lesson's tier; unbuilt depth carries queued labels, never filler.
  DESIGN (owner REVERSED their earlier choice on 2026-07-13, second
  instruction wins): ASU-style palette is now PRIMARY — --ember token IS
  maroon #8C1D40 (universal accent), --gold #FFC627 for lines/chips/fork
  and dark-board accents (never body text on white — contrast). Trademark
  exposure was flagged twice; owner accepted it. Layout: left sidebar
  (semesters → courses → current course's lessons) on all course/lesson
  pages, stacking below 1000px. MathJax 3 loads from CDN on all lesson
  pages (tex-chtml, \( \) inline) — existing equations remain hand-built
  HTML/CSS; write NEW lecture math in either, prefer LaTeX going forward.
  Depth continues in batches, Core-60 first; the "522 fully written
  lessons in one pass" demand remains infeasible and is delivered
  incrementally instead. Per-lesson video embeds are verified-only
  (fabricating YouTube IDs is prohibited regardless of instructions).
  Library-tab embeds are generated ONLY from registry/card URLs that are
  embeddable YouTube watch/playlist links — all verified. Client search:
  docs/curriculum/search-index.json + JS on the curriculum index.
  Deploy target (changed 2026-07-17: owner deleted the sundevilfactory org
  by accident while renaming; full repo + history live locally):
  github.com/nexuskw/nexuskw.github.io →
  https://nexuskw.github.io/ (root URL, no /asu path). Owner creates
  the org + empty public repo; push from this Mac; Pages = main:/docs.
  The old sundevilfactory.github.io/asu URL is dead.

- Preview questions ("preview" field, rendered above Taught-from): 522/522 —
  COMPLETE (Core 60 numeric micro-problems + all Tier-3 conceptual pairs,
  all 8 semesters). Rules that governed them: original wording, match the
  lesson scope + cited source, no invented plant data. New lessons added
  later must ship with a preview field.
- Source registry: data/sources.json — every URL verified live before entry
  (OCW course pages, NPTEL course pages, Open Library work pages,
  smrp.org, nebosh.org.uk). Sources without verifiable official URLs stay
  plain text. build.py linkify() renders them.
- Video-source policy (applied 2026-07-13): registry entries may carry
  "watch" (verified lecture-videos page → rendered "Watch lectures ▶"),
  "label" (visible note, e.g. NPTEL's "alternative (enable captions)"),
  and "arabic" (verified Arabic source → rendered "In Arabic — alternative";
  bar RELAXED by owner decision 2026-07-13: independent Arabic educators and
  unofficial recordings of real university lectures are acceptable if
  on-topic, technically sound, and watchable — each URL oEmbed/title
  verified before entry; ripped paid courses and content farms remain
  excluded; English always stays the primary link; where the source is an
  unofficial recording, add {"url":…, "note":"unofficial recording"}).
  Registry uses topic-suffixed match tokens (e.g. "LearnChemE (CU Boulder)
  — fluids") so an Arabic source never renders on a lesson whose topic it
  doesn't cover. Priority: OCW video pages > university channels
  (Jeff Hanson/TTU via channel id UCXKW_dKcpFh358S1rV5qBDw — NOT the
  @JeffHanson handle, which is a different channel; LearnChemE/CU Boulder)
  > professional bodies (SME channel UCiEiOeFUl4Ytrv63Udugckg, Mobius
  Institute) > independent channels labeled "supplementary" (The Efficient
  Engineer, RealPars). NPTEL links are kept as labeled alternatives, never
  removed without a verified replacement.

- Tier 1 done: y1s1-mp1-02 (casting solidification), y1s1-mp1-03 (casting
  practice, quality & defects).
- Tier 2 done (batch 1, A-block): see ledger comments in data/y1s1.json and
  content/lessons/. Next batches in order: remainder of A (machining/welding/
  NDT/sheet/plastics), then B, C, D, E, F, G.
- Tier 2 lessons without a written guide yet are tagged `core60` but have no
  `content` field — the course page automatically shows them as
  "study guide queued".
- Every new Tier 1/2 page: follow the gold standard structure of
  y1s1-mp1-02/03. Verify every citation and URL before adding. Label all
  industrial numbers "representative" unless from a cited source.

### Writing rules (non-negotiable)

- Derive or source every equation. Never state a result bare.
- Only the SOURCES list above may be cited. Verify editions or omit them.
- Kuwait examples only from the six companies; name process/equipment;
  never invent plant data.
- All photo captions honest: "representative example: X" when the facility
  is not identifiable. Never caption a stock photo as a named Kuwait plant.
- No fabricated URLs. Verify every external link live before committing.
- English only. Professor's voice: direct, precise, no filler, no
  motivational language.
